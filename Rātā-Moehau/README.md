# Rātā Moehau genomics

This is a [Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research](https://landcareresearch.co.nz/) and [Genomics Aotearoa](https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz/) High-Quality Genomes project for the Aotearoa endemic plant rātā Moehau, *Metrosideros bartlettii*. This research was funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment through New Zealand's Biological Heritage National Science Challenge, the Strategic Science Investment Fund for Crown Research Institutes, and Genomics Aotearoa.

This work is associated with the publication: Prebble et al., 'Demographic history and genetic diversity of rātā Moehau (_Metrosideros bartlettii_; Myrtaceae), a critically endangered Aotearoa New Zealand endemic tree', in prep.

Project collaborators: Jessie Prebble (primary contact), Thomas Buckley, Natalie Forsdick, Duckchul Park, Alex Verry at Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research, together with Indigenous partners at Ngāti Kuri, and Emma Simpkins at Auckland Botanic Gardens.

Data generated as input: whole-genomes ONT long-read data, Illumina short-read data including an Omni-C library, RNA-seq data.

Outputs: Reference genome assembly and annotation, and species-wide SNPs for demographic history and genetic diversity analyses.
